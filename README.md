# Bike sharing data exploration

Exploring bike sharing data from Oslo, Norway.

Project done in the INF121 course as a part of a [Master in Data Science at NBMU](https://www.nmbu.no/en/studies/study-options/master/master-of-science-in-data-science).

## Abstract

The bike sharing system in Oslo publishes [open data](https://developer.oslobysykkel.no/data) about trips made by their users.
We analysed one month usage (June 2016) and looked at typical trip durations, daily traffic patterns as well as movement at various times. Our results indicate that [Affinity Propagation clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_propagation) based on trips between stations can distinguish movement patterns between weekends and typical commute times during weekdays.
